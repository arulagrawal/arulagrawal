## Hi

I like writing code, especially go and python!

I like sysadmin and devopsy stuff, and self-host [as much as possible](https://status.arul.io).

Some of my personal use code goes [here](https://git.arul.io)

My repo of stuff I'm currently running and playing around with is [here](https://git.arul.io/arul/docker-compose).
